## Project Overview

~~Making an easier process for streamers to read off song requests on stream. Also allows for chat to implement their own song requests and have it play as a Spotify or YouTube playlist.~~

~~(Maybe implement simultaneous runtime with the streamer)~~

Creating a Google Extension using React w/ Typescript that makes a listen party room. The app takes in YouTube URLs and plays the songs in real time with the users in the room.
